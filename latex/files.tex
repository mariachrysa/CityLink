\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{cityLink_8c}{city\+Link.\+c}} \\*This program receives as input a text file which contains the adjacency matrix for a specific set of cities, and the indexes of two cities interpeting the source city and the destination city. It then checks if there is a connection (immediate or not) between the two cities and prints the transitive closure list, with the according messages for each implementation. It works based on the getopt library, allowing the user to choose what implementations to ask for }{\pageref{cityLink_8c}}{}
